AIM:To study and implement C++ decision making statements
THEORY:
Decision-making statements in C++ are used to control the flow of program execution based on certain conditions. They allow a program to choose different paths or actions depending on whether a condition is true or false, making programs dynamic and responsive.

1. Purpose of Decision-Making Statements
Decision-making statements help a program to make logical decisions and execute specific blocks of code accordingly. This enables programs to react differently to different inputs or situations, which is essential for creating interactive and functional software.

2. Types of Decision-Making Statements
C++ provides several decision-making constructs:

if statement: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
if-else statement: Executes one block of code if the condition is true, otherwise executes an alternate block.
else-if ladder: Handles multiple conditions sequentially, executing the first true conditionâ€™s block.
switch statement: Used when multiple discrete values need to be checked for a variable, improving readability over multiple if-else statements.
